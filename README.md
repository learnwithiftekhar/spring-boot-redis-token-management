# Redis Session Management Project

## Description
The **Redis Session Management** project is a Spring Boot-based application designed to manage user sessions using **Redis** as a session store. This project makes use of modern back-end technologies and paradigms, including **Spring Session**, **Spring Security**, and **Spring Data Redis**, along with **PostgreSQL** for additional data persistence needs. It is structured to ensure secure, scalable, and high-performance session management.

## Features
- **Session Management with Redis**: Leverages Redis as a highly scalable and efficient session storage solution using Spring Session.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Supports data persistence with PostgreSQL.
- **Spring Security Integration**: Provides security mechanisms for user authentication and authorization.
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely manage stateless authentication.
- **Validation**: Ensures data integrity and request validation using Spring's Validation framework.
- **Testing**: Includes robust testing configurations for application reliability.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Java 17 or above**
- **Maven** (or alternative build tools for Java projects)
- **Redis** (set up and running)
- **PostgreSQL** (set up and running)

## Stack and Dependencies
The application uses the following dependencies:
1. **Spring Boot Starters**:
    - `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`: Provides JPA and repository support.
    - `spring-boot-starter-data-redis`: Enables integration with Redis.
    - `spring-session-data-redis`: Manages HTTP session data in Redis.
    - `spring-boot-starter-security`: Adds authentication and authorization capabilities.
    - `spring-boot-starter-web`: RESTful API development support.
    - `spring-boot-starter-validation`: Validation for request and data models.
2. **PostgreSQL**:
    - PostgreSQL driver for interacting with relational databases.
3. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**:
    - `jjwt-api`, `jjwt-impl`, `jjwt-jackson`: For creating, parsing, and validating JWTs.
4. **Lombok**:
    - Simplifies Java development by auto-generating boilerplate code such as getters, setters, and constructors.
5. **Testing**:
    - `spring-boot-starter-test` and `spring-security-test` for unit and integration tests.

## Configuration
The application requires a few configurations for connecting to Redis, PostgreSQL, and other external dependencies. These configurations can be included in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

### Example Configuration
```properties
# Redis Configuration
spring.session.store-type=redis
spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6379

# PostgreSQL Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

# JWT Configuration
jwt.secret=your_jwt_secret_key
jwt.expiration=3600
```

Replace `your_database`, `your_username`, `your_password`, and `your_jwt_secret_key` with actual values specific to your environment.

## Building and Running
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build and package the application using Maven:
```shell script
mvn clean install
```
4. Run the application:
```shell script
mvn spring-boot:run
```
5. The application should now be running on the default port, e.g., `http://localhost:8080`.

## Testing
The project includes unit and integration tests leveraging:
- `spring-boot-starter-test`
- `spring-security-test`

To run tests, execute the following:
```shell script
mvn test
```

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can access the RESTful API for session management and user security. Examples include:
- **User Authentication and JWT Generation**.
- **Session Management (via Redis)**.
- **Secured Endpoints** (accessible through JWT authentication).
- CRUD operations with PostgreSQL data using JPA.

API endpoints and detailed documentation can be generated or added later (e.g., using tools like Swagger for easier interaction).
